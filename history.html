                <p>
                    Akosombo International School was established in 1962 to provide educational facilities at the
                    Kindergarten and Primary levels for the children of workers (mostly expatriates), who were engaged
                    in the construction of the Akosombo dam.
                    <br>
                    The School, at its inception, was an interesting experiment in education. Of the 140 students who
                    were enrolled in the school at the time, only 28 (i.e. 20%), were Ghanaians.
                    <br>
                    The rest were foreigners from such diverse countries as Italy, United States of America, United
                    Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Pakistan, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Portugal. All of these foreign
                    students received tuition at AIS that enabled them to write examinations in their home countries.
                    <br>
                    With the completion of the Akosombo Dam project in 1966, the Akosombo International School was
                    opened to the children/wards of all employees of the Volta River Authority. In 1968, a regular
                    co-educational secondary department was added to the existing nursery and primary schools.
                    Facilities were put in place to accommodate boarders. At its establishment, the secondary school
                    department was intended to follow technical courses in order to take advantage of the numerous
                    facilities in Akosombo for such pursuits (e.g. carpentry workshops, vehicle workshop, mechanical
                    workshop, etc.) However, other courses such as General Science, General Arts, Home Economics and
                    Business have been added to the School’s curriculum. In September 1990, a two-stream Junior
                    Secondary School Department was introduced at Akosombo; and January 1994 saw the rst intake of the
                    three-stream Senior Secondary School in preparation for the phasing-out of the then existing
                    secondary school system.
                    <br>
                    The year 1982 saw the further expansion of the facilities of the School with the opening of the
                    Akuse Kindergarten and Primary Schools, as the second stream of the Akosombo International School.
                    The Akuse School was established to cater for the children/wards of VRA sta in charge of the
                    hydro-electric facilities at Akuse. A Junior Secondary School department commenced at Akuse in
                    September 2002.
                    <br>
                    Kyease Kindergarten was set up to prepare pupils adequately before entering the public primary
                    schools in Akosombo. In September 2002, however, the Kyease kindergarten was expanded into a primary
                    school due to increase in the population of the Akosombo township and the consequent increasing
                    demand for admission to the primary school at the main campus (i.e. at Community One).
                    <br>
                    In the mid-1990s, the VRA started work on its thermal power project at Aboadze, near Takoradi. A new
                    township was built for sta at Aboadze; and in November 1999, a one-stream Kindergarten and Primary
                    School was established at the VRA compound to provide educational facilities for the new community.
                    A Junior Secondary department commenced at Aboadze in September 2001.
                    <br>
                    The first headmaster of the rst School at Akosombo was Mr. W.H.D. Ames, a Canadian. He was succeeded
                    by other expatriate headmasters, i.e. Mr. J.B. Morris, September 1963 to August 1966, and Mr. B.A.
                    Sea-man, August 1966 to July 1968. The first Ghanaian headmaster was the late Mr. P.D. Quartey Jnr.,
                    who from September 1968 until his retirement in December 1973 worked very hard to establish on a rm
                    basis the Secondary Department of the school. The second Headmaster, Mr. B.A. Sam, was at post from
                    January 1974 until his retirement in December 1998. Under Mr. B.A. Sam, Mr. N. Ohene-Okae and Mrs.
                    G. Manieson-Annancy served as Assistant Heads responsible for Basic and Secondary Schools
                    respectively. Mrs. G. Manieson-Annancy assumed duty as Headmistress from January 1999; and Messrs
                    John K. Tawiah and Arnold K. Seshie were appointed as Assistant Heads.
